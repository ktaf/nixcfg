# bc-250

NixOS implementation of SteamOS for the ASRock AMD-BC-250 — tuned to boot fast, stay lean, and land you straight in gaming mode.

## Highlights
- SteamOS-style experience on NixOS for a compact, console-like box
- Jovian has been tested and works, but it is laggy and more resource-consuming on this hardware

## Notes
- BIOS of choice: P3 Modded version
- GPU governor: WIP, candidates:
  - `https://github.com/Magnap/cyan-skillfish-governor`
  - `https://github.com/filippor/oberon-governor`
